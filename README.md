Welcome to the Alleva test application. This is a simple AngularJS app
which you will be using to demonstrate your skills in migrating AngularJS
code to modern Angular.

The goal of this exercise is for you to:

- Identify the AngularJS code that needs to be migrated.
- Identify the Angular 2+ code that needs to be written (use TypeScript).
- Identify and Refactor any AngularJS non-standard code practices when converting.  
- Use the Angular CLI to build the application.
- Write and test the new Angular 2+ code.
- The application must maintain the current routes.
- The application must use SCSS for styling.
- The application should maintain an index page.
- Ensure the application works as expected.
- Models should be immutable.
- Make good use of comments, and self-documenting code. No comments in markup.

Bonus Points:

- Forms should use proper validation techniques.
- Application should use proper type checking (no "any" types for instance).
- Add meta to Routes (e.g. page title).
- Implement a good linting strategy.
- Implement a good directory structure.
- Use loading indicators where necessary.
