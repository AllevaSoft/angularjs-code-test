Welcome to the Alleva test application. This is a simple AngularJS app
which you will be using to demonstrate your skills in migrating AngularJS
code to modern Angular.

The goal of this exercise is for you to:

- Identify the AngularJS code that needs to be migrated.
- Identify the Angular 2+ code that needs to be written.
- Write and test the new Angular 2+ code.
- The application must maintain the current routes.
- The application must use SCSS for styling.
- Ensure the application works as expected.
